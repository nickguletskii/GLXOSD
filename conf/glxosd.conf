##### NOTES ###########################################################################
# The syntax of this configuration file is very basic.                                #
# Each line is either a comment (starts with a #), or a key-value pair.               #
# The key and value are separated by the first equals sign.                           #
# ALL TRAILING AND LEADING WHITESPACE WILL BE LOST!!!                                 #
# If you want to preserve the whitespace in the value, surround the value with quotes.#

# #define XK_F10                           0xffc7

##### GENERAL INFORMATION SETTINGS #####

# !!! ATTENTION! This project uses Boost Format! For more information, open the link below! !!!

# The format string for the FPS. The only argument is a floating point number that represents the FPS.

# The format for temperature strings.

##### LIBSENSOR INFORMATION SETTINGS #####

# The format string that gets printed for each chip that reports temperature through libsensors.
# The only argument is the name of the chip.
libsensors_chip_format = %1%:\n

# The format string that prints the feature name and it's temperature.
# For each chip, there are different "features".
# For example, an Intel 2500k has 5 temperature sensors - one is a general sensor, and a sensor for each core.
# Each temperature sensor will be in it's own "feature".
# The first argument is the name of the feature, and the second argument is the temperature string (not a number).

# Chips with names that match this regex (Boost Xpressive variation) will not be displayed.

# For example, the following line contains a filter that will hide Nouveau temperature information.

# This is a filter for features of chips.
# If you don't want to see the temperatures of different cores, or something similar, this is for you.
# Features with names that match this regex (Boost Xpressive variation) will not be displayed.
libsensors_chip_feature_filter = NULL
# For example, the following line contains a filter that will hide individual core information on a 2500k.
#libsensors_chip_feature_filter = Core.*
# AMD users will have to write regexes like this:
#libsensors_chip_feature_filter = "((IN[0-9]+|5vsb|vbat|fan[0-9]+|\+5v)\:.*)"

##### NVIDIA INFORMATION SETTINGS #####

# The format string for NVIDIA GPU temperatures (if you have an NVIDIA graphics card and NVCTRL).
# The first argument is the name of the graphics card, e.g. "GeForce GTX 560 Ti".
# The second argument is the ID of the graphics card.
# The third argument is the temperature string (not a number).
